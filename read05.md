# structuring comparision operators
  * in any condition there is usually one operators and two oprends

 # logical operators in javascript

* compression operators usually return single valus of true or false
* logical AND(&&)
* logical OR (||)
* logical NOT (!)
# loops
* Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
# type of loops
1. for loops
  *  loops through a block of code a number of times
2. while loops
 * The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true
 
 # syntax 
 1. for loop
  * for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
 * Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution     of the code block.
  * Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the   
code block.

* Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed

2. while loop
 * while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
  
}
