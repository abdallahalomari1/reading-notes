##  to create web site you should know 
1.Every website should be designed for the 
target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the 
site owner. It is therefore very important to 
understand who your target audience is 
2.why they are coming
3. What Information Your Visitors Need

# Target Audience
1. individuals: you must know 
* age range of your target audience
*  live in urban or rural areas
* average income of visitors
* How often do they use the web?
2. Companies: you must know 
* size of the company or relevant department
* How large is the budget they control
* What is the position of people in the company who visit your site
# What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve
* First you want to create a list 
of reasons why people would 
be coming to your site. You can 
then assign the list of tasks to 
the fictional visitors 
# grouping andSimilarity
* When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend. Here are some ways this can be achieved.
1. Proximity
2. Closure
3. Continuance
4. White Space
5. color 
6. Borders
# HTML 
* HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already, and this set of elements include:

1. the header which contains the title and navigation bar.
2. the main which includes articles, sections and asides.
3. and the footer part where some info such copyright information takes place.

# simple html structure

1. the <header> and <footer>
* elements can be used for:  The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.  A header or footer for an individual <article> or <section> within the page.

2.navigation bar
* the <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

3. articles
* The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated, This could be an individual article or blog entry, a comment or forum post, or any other independent piece of content.

4. asides
* he <aside> element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an <article> element or not.

5. sections
* The <section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.
