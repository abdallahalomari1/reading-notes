# How computers work
# How to invent a device can think
**to creat device can thinking You have to do four main tasks.**
1. You need to get input.
2. Storage of informatioin
3. processing informatioin
4. output informatioin.
* These four things are common to all computers.
# the binary number system
*  in the the decimal number system : Consists in tan digit (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
* in the binary number system : consists two digit (0 1)
# text in binary number system
* Convert text into binary. Computers store all characters    as numbers stored as binary data. Binary code uses the      digits of 0 and 1 (binary numbers) to represent computer    instructions or text. Each instruction or symbol gets a     bit string assignment. The strings can correspond to        instructions, letters, or symbols.  In computing, these     codes are used for encoding data
# image in binary number system
* any image consist small point called pixels 
* can show any coloer by number 
* to create the picture, a grid can be set out and the squares coloured (1 – black and 0 – white). But before the grid can be created, the size of the grid needs be known. This data is called metadata and computers need metadata to know the size of an image. If the metadata for the image to be created is 10x10, this means the picture will be 10 pixels across and 10 pixels down.

# sound in binary number system
* The sound card can recreate the stored sound using a Digital to Analogue Convertor (DAC). This converts the series of binary numbers back into a changing voltage which can make a speaker (in a set of headphones or external speakers) vibrate to reproduce the sound.

# circuts and logic
* Computers often chain logic gates together, by taking the output from one gate and using it as the input to another gate. We call that a logic circuit
