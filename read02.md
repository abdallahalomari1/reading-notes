## Git Tutorial
## introduction
* Before beginning this tutorial, it is highly recommended that you have a solid understanding of the Terminal (for Mac) or Command Line (for Windows and Linux).

In order to explain Git, we have to first explain various aspects of Version Control

#  Version Control
* Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified
# Centralized Version Control
 * The need for collaboration within a developer team on a single file or set of files led to the advent of the Centralized Version Control System (CVCS).

#  what is git 
* the term snapshot is used in the git reference site as well. It is the replacement term for "Revision". In other version control systems, changes to individual files are tracked and refered to as revisions, but with git you are tracking the entire workspace, so they use the term snapshot to denote the difference
 
 * Git almost never truly deletes anything that's been checked into the repository, even when running commands that remove commits from history or delete branches. ... In general, git will require the --force ( -f ) or --hard flags for those commands
