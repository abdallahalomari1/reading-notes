## introduction
* Before beginning this tutorial, it is highly recommended that you have a solid understanding of the Terminal (for Mac) or Command Line (for Windows and Linux).

In order to explain Git, we have to first explain various aspects of Version Control

#  Version Control
* Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified
# Centralized Version Control
 * The need for collaboration within a developer team on a single file or set of files led to the advent of the Centralized Version Control System (CVCS).
