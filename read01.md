# What is Markdown?
*Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like #
# Syntax guide
1. Headers(# ## ###)
2. Emphasis(* / **)
3. Lists (Unordered and  Ordered).
4. Images:**![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)**
5. Links **[]()**
6. Blockquotes

# GitHub Flavored Markdown
* GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features, many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com.
Note that some features of GitHub Flavored Markdown are only available in the descriptions and comments of Issues and Pull Requests. These include @mentions as well as references to SHA-1 hashes, Issues, and Pull Requests. Task Lists are also available in Gist comments and in Gist Markdown files
# Task Lists
**- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item**
# tables 
* You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |
# Automatic linking for URLs
* Any URL (like http://www.github.com/) will be automatically converted into a clickable link.
# What is GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. You can see examples of GitHub Pages sites in the GitHub Pages examples collection
